# The Simmering Bone Website (Web Dev Final Project)

## Overview
This is an informative e-commerce website for The Simmering Bone, a local company
that produces sustainable bone broth.  The website contains 3 pages at present: Home,
Market, and About Us.  The ingredients page will be implemented later.  Contains a 
functional shop page as well as a polished layout all around.  Animations are implemented
using GSAP, an importable library.  This is both our final project and a private project 
we are doing for The Simmering Bone, so some features are still in development. As such,
none of this code may be reused for commercial or personal purposes.
